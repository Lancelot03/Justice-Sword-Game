# Justice Sword Game
This project is based on an action game. In this project, HTML, CSS and JavaScript are used. This project includes a basic introduction to web development. 
-  In the fast-growing field of software engineering and development and even more rapidly growing sector of game development the future is hard to predict.
-  Platform game (often simplified as platformer or jump 'n' run games) are a video game genre and subgenre of action game in which the core objective is to move 
the player character between points in a rendered environment.3D Graphics- The game must contain 3D models, and render these in the game. 3D enviroments were never 
a requirement, and platform ganes with 2D environment could still open up for 3D objects.

Goals are objectives that a person or a system desire to achieve. In a game, a goal is what we strive for (e.g., goals can be to kill the dragon and rescue the princess). Goals are fundamental to games; they determine what the player has to do to win the game, and give the player a sense of accomplishment and progression.
